1. Introduction

The Library Management System is a web-based application designed to simplify the process of managing books in a library. It allows users to add, view, update, and delete book records through an intuitive interface. This project is developed using Flask for backend logic, SQLAlchemy for database management, and HTML/CSS for the frontend.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how modern web frameworks can be used to build efficient CRUD applications suitable for academic and small-scale environments.

2. Objectives

The main objectives of the system are:

To create a simple and user-friendly interface for managing library books.

To implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

To store book data efficiently in an SQLite database using SQLAlchemy.

To understand and implement the MVC (Model-View-Controller) structure in Flask.

To gain hands-on experience with backend and frontend integration.

3. Technologies Used
Backend Technologies

Python 3

SQLAlchemy ORM

Jinja2 Template Engine

Frontend Technologies

HTML5

CSS3

Bootstrap (optional, if added)

Database

SQLite (automatically generated as library.db)

Tools Used

VS Code (Code Editor)

GitHub (Version Control)

Pip (Package Installation)

4. System Architecture

The project follows a structured layout:

library-management/
│── app.py
│── models.py
│── static/
│   └── style.css
│── templates/
│   ├── base.html
│   ├── book_list.html
│   ├── add_book.html
│   └── edit_book.html
│── requirements.txt
│── README.md

4.1 Model

The model (models.py) defines the Book class with fields:

id

title

author

year

isbn

4.2 View

HTML templates create the frontend interface:

Add Book Page

Edit Book Page

List Books Page

4.3 Controller

app.py manages routes and connections between frontend and database.

5. Features of the System
1. Add New Books

Users can enter book details including title, author, year, and ISBN. Required fields are validated.

2. View All Books

The homepage lists all books stored in the database using a clean table layout.

3. Edit Book Details

Users can update existing book information through a dedicated edit form.

4. Delete Books

Books can be removed from the database securely with confirmation prompts.

5. Automatic Database Creation

On first run, Flask-SQLAlchemy automatically creates library.db.

6. Working of the System

User opens the application through 127.0.0.1:5000.

Flask loads the default route, redirecting to the books list page.

SQLAlchemy interacts with the SQLite database to fetch or modify data.

User selects actions such as Add, Edit, or Delete.

Flask processes forms, updates the database, and refreshes the views.

7. Advantages of the Project

Simple, fast, and lightweight.

Easy to understand and extend for beginners.

Demonstrates real-world use of Flask routing and database models.

Responsive design for larger screens.

Suitable as a mini-project or college assignment.

8. Limitations

No authentication or user login system.

No search or filter functionality.

Basic UI (can be enhanced further).

Only supports a single user at a time.

9. Future Enhancements

The system can be extended with additional features:

User Login System using Flask-Login

Search Bar to filter books

Pagination for large libraries

Export Books to CSV/Excel

Upload Book Cover Images

Dark Theme UI

Switch to MySQL/PostgreSQL for bigger databases

10. Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the development of a full-stack application using Flask, SQLAlchemy, HTML, and CSS. It covers essential concepts such as routing, form handling, database modeling, and template rendering.

The Library Management System serves as a strong foundation for more advanced systems and showcases the practical application of Python web development for real-world use cases.
